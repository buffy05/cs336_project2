This file contains examples of prompts used for the LLM in database_llm.py.
Experimenting with prompt structure is key to getting good SQL output.

# Base Prompt Structure (from database_llm.py):

Given the following PostgreSQL database schema:

```sql
{schema}
```

Translate the following user question into a single, valid PostgreSQL SELECT query. Only output the SQL query.

User Question: {question}

SQL Query:

# Example Variations to Try:

## Variation 1: More Direct

Schema:
```sql
{schema}
```
Question: {question}

Write the PostgreSQL SELECT query only.
SQL:

## Variation 2: Role Playing

You are a PostgreSQL expert. Given the schema below, write the SELECT query for the user's question.
Schema:
```sql
{schema}
```
User Question: {question}

# Notes on Prompting:

*   Clearly stating the database type (PostgreSQL) might help.
*   Explicitly asking for *only* the SQL query is important.
*   Ending the prompt with a label like "SQL Query:" or "SQL:" seems to guide the LLM.
*   Including the schema within ```sql ... ``` markdown might help the LLM parse it correctly.
*   Keep the schema definition concise (only CREATE TABLE and maybe a few INSERTs) to fit within the context window (N_CTX=2048 for this model).
